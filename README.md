# Mobi Writer

A Python3 script that writes files to the mobi file format. Works, but still in development. Generated content at present is viewable in calibre, but I have yet to successfully open it on an actual ereader.


## Running

	python writer.py
	
This will generate a file `Test.mobi` which can be viewed with software like calibre. The contents of the file will look like

	Testing Testing 1 2 3
